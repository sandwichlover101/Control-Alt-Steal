<p> <b> Interrogation: </b> </p>
<br>
<p> <b>Mary Yoo (wife of Garry): </b> “We live at the Blue Lagoon next to the train station. Garry worked as a businessman for the bank. I remember dropping him off at the train station at 8pm last night as his train was at 10pm. A young boy was working there at the train station named Java Skripte, he and Garry were the only ones there. 
    I then went out with my friends and stayed at my friend's house near the casino. Garry and Williams have been bestfriends since ages and one day went to the casino. Garry accused Williams of cheating on the slot machines. The two of them started fighting and a server, Valentino Carolino, had to stop their fight. Valentino has a criminal record and people always said she was after Garry as she claimed he stole her husband's job.”
<br>
    <b>Valentino Carolino: </b> “Garry lied on his resume to get that job, but I wouldn't kill him so my husband could get the job. I was working at the casino last night and talked to some friends. I also saw Christine Crow and Cameron Carter going for a walk towards the Great Lake, why don’t you question them?”
<br>
   <b>Christine Crow and Cameron Carter:</b> “We were going on a walk after visiting the new french restaurant near the bank. And for reference we were walking around the bank, we never went near the Great Lake, as I had to upload my review of the restaurant that night.”
<br>
    <b>Java Skripte: </b> “Yes, I was at the train station working my later night shift, but Garry never boarded the train. I saw him talk to a girl with blond curly hair and some tall guy with glasses, facial hair and brown eyes.
    The man looked like a nerd. Anyways at like 9pm Garry and the others left the train station and started walking towards the warehouse.” 
<br>
    <b>Lee Beery Shush and Devyn Dahmer: </b> “Yeah we were in the warehouse with Garry not to kill him, but to give him the business plans he needed to take with him to Hilton Head to discuss our business. After that we went to the casino and we saw Valentino there”
